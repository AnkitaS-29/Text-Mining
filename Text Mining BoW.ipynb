So isn't that saving money?\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, \\n\\nthen their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was\\n\\nalready $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they\\n\\nreduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:\\n\\n\\n\\n1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.\\n\\n \\n\\n2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even \\n\\nthe buyers for other cars will pay less.\\n\\n\\n\\nIsn't that saving money?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$0.02,\\n\\ndoug.\\n\", \"\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr5.135153.11132@wdl.loral.com> gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W.
